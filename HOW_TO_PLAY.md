# How to Play (TOA)

TOA is a timing game where you **aim** at one of four boxes and click with the correct mouse button **right when the tile lands in that box**.

## Goal
Hit incoming tiles at the intended moment.

A successful hit requires:
- The **correct box** selected on the keyboard
- The **correct mouse button** for the tile color
- **Good timing** (click close to the landing moment)

## Controls

### Box Selection (Keyboard)
Use the keyboard to choose which box/window you're targeting:

- **W** → Top box  
- **D** → Right box  
- **S** or **Space** → Bottom box  
- **A** → Left box  

This is your “aim” or “focus” box.

### Click Type (Mouse)
Tile color tells you which mouse button to press:

- **Red tile** → **Left click**
- **Blue tile** → **Right click**

---

## What You See
- **4 boxes** around the center (top / right / bottom / left)
- **Tiles** slide in from the sides toward one of those boxes
- The correct hit moment is when the tile **lands in its target box**

---

## How to Hit a Note
For each incoming tile:

1. **Select the target box** with **W/A/S(or Space)/D**
2. Watch the tile approach that box
3. **When the tile lands in the box**, click:
   - **Left click** if the tile is **red**
   - **Right click** if the tile is **blue**

If your box selection is wrong, your mouse button is wrong, or your timing is too early/late, the note will not score well (or will miss).

## Timing Tip: Move First, Click Second
It’s usually better to move your box selection **slightly before the beat**.

Why?
- If you wait until the exact landing moment, you’re trying to:
  - switch boxes
  - choose the correct mouse button
  - click on time  
  all at once.

Instead:
- **Prepare your box selection early**
- Then at the landing moment, your only job is to **click the correct mouse button**

This is easiest on average-speed songs. On very fast patterns, you’ll still do your best—timing windows are tighter.

## Judgments (Hit Grades)
When you hit a note, you’ll get a judgment based on timing accuracy:

- **300** = very accurate  
- **100 / 50** = less accurate  
- **miss** = wrong input, too early/late, or no click

## Quick Checklist Per Tile
**Box? Color? Timing?**
- **Box**: are you aimed at the right window (W/A/S(or Space)/D)?
- **Color**: red = left click, blue = right click
- **Timing**: click when it lands

---

## Missing Notes
If you don’t click at all, the note will still become a **miss** once it passes the allowed timing window. Staying mentally ahead of the next tile helps a lot.
