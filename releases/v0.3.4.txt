## ✨ TOA v0.3.4 - New Levels & Audio Support

### Notes
- If you do not hear hitsounds on some maps, it is likely because the required hitsound files (e.g., soft-hitnormal0.ogg) are missing from the beatmap folder. This is not a code error; the game will play any hitsound file present that matches the note's hitsound index and type.

### Changed
- Audio file loading now supports multiple extensions: mp3, ogg, wav, flac, aac, m4a for both music and hitsounds. The game will use the first matching file found for each type.
- All old levels have been replaced with a new set of levels and songs.
